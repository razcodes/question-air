# Welcome to Questionair :question:

A game to play while you're relaxing with your friends :smile:

## Description

A game, which allows you to submit questions using the interactive form on the homepage. After submitting them, answer them and you'll get the score and a detailed description of your performance! :blush:

## Rules

The form consists of 5 input fields - 1 for the question, 1 for the correct answer(this is the _first_ input field in the answers column!). Once you submit your questions, they are stored and the order of the answers are mixed. The two buttons appearing on the sides of the form allow you to choose what to do next - you can arrange the order in which the questions appear(the original question order is available to you via the Original Question Order dropdown menu :blush:) or you can go straight into the answering the questions. Once you have answered all questions, you will go to a page, which has a button, taking you to the results page, where you can see the score of the game. Once you are done marvelling at your performance, you can click the _See answers_ button, which will take you to the Answers page, which shows the questions, the correct answers and you responses. If you want to play again - there is a button for that :blush:. If you hit it, the questions you've submitted will be deleted and another round of the game will begin. :blush:
